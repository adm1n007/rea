# Optional NativeAOT metadata recovery

REA has a built-in read-only snapshot parser for x64 PE targets with .NET 8 RTR
9.1 metadata. It parses the exact admitted Ghidra session snapshot and uses an
in-memory overlay for rehydrated metadata; it does not define Ghidra DataTypes,
labels, functions, or memory bytes. The hydration semantics are adapted from
[Washi1337/ghidra-nativeaot](https://github.com/Washi1337/ghidra-nativeaot) at
`effeb734fc570c32650f88b159608979dc7b423e` (MIT), cross-checked against
.NET's `MethodTable.h` at runtime commit
`a3b2d40328be0be3f8dd43f0e5cc925b8827b044` (MIT). The required notice ships in
[`licenses/nativeaot-parser-MIT.txt`](../licenses/nativeaot-parser-MIT.txt).

The optional headless Ghidra adapter remains available for database annotations
and broader recovery. It uses the same pinned upstream commit as an opt-in
submodule and is a separate, more capable workflow.

The parser currently handles x64 PE32+ and RTR 9.1, including bounded
DEHYDRATED_DATA processing, MethodTable relationships, virtual slots, and
frozen strings. Other RTR versions and PE architectures are reported as
unsupported or partial. The matching .NET 8.0.22 fixture is source-built and
the parser's Windows-host Ghidra workflow has not yet had a real Windows-host
run. This does not establish Windows Ghidra import or decompiler behavior.
Windows Ghidra P0 has no database mutation authority. A PE/CLI or ReadyToRun
assembly should use `inspect_managed_artifact`; it is not NativeAOT.

## Build and configure

Bring your own supported Ghidra/JDK installation. This developer build needs
existing `git`, `javac` and `jar`; it does not invoke Gradle, download toolchains,
or change host configuration:

```sh
git submodule update --init third_party/ghidra-nativeaot
npm run build:ghidra:nativeaot
export REA_GHIDRA_NATIVEAOT_JAR="$PWD/_reference/nativeaot-integration/extension/rea-ghidra-nativeaot.jar"
```

The build requires a clean pinned upstream checkout, compiles unchanged upstream
Java plus the REA facade, uses a fresh classes directory, and writes the JAR and
build manifest under ignored `_reference/`. `REA_NATIVEAOT_BUILD_ROOT` can select
another local output directory; `REA_NATIVEAOT_SOURCE` can select an equivalent
clean pinned source checkout. Neither output nor compiled fixture belongs in Git
or the npm package. An installed REA accepts an existing explicitly supplied JAR.

REA commits the actual JAR SHA-256 into the analysis profile, copies identical
bytes into the owned runtime, rechecks the digest before loading, and closes the
classloader/project on session close. Profiles cannot enable code absent from
explicit local configuration. JARs execute within Ghidra; supply a build you trust.
The producer's reported source revision is build metadata, not an attestation of
arbitrary caller-supplied bytes. The bounded loader accepts regular JARs up to
8 MiB to limit startup artifact memory; this does not truncate analysis results.

## Use existing tools

Open the executable with provider `ghidra`. For an x64 PE, `inspect_native_load_image`
returns `observations.metadata_recovery` inline from the captured source snapshot,
including the RTR header, MethodTable addresses, frozen strings, derived overlay
identity, and examined/recovered counts. Its enclosing `unsupported` load-image
status means independent PE load-image verification was not performed; it does
not mean the metadata parser failed or the executable failed to load.

Pass a returned MethodTable address to `inspect_native_data_type`. A direct PE
query also derives the snapshot metadata from the authenticated Ghidra session
handshake, so it does not require a preceding load-image call. In a persistent
MCP session, load-image followed by type inspection reuses that same derivation.
The database result remains `unavailable` when Ghidra has no DataType at that
address; its `metadata_recovery.source` is `read-only-derived-overlay` and
carries related type, interface, slot, and target observations. Generated
address identities do not claim original managed names. The parser does not
merge frozen literals into Ghidra's database string inventory. Follow slot
targets with `analyze_function` and ordinary cross-references.

The built-in CLI path uses a MethodTable address returned by the parser or
another observation:

```sh
rea inspect-native-load-image ./NativeAotFixture --provider ghidra --json
rea inspect-native-data-type ./NativeAotFixture --address 0xMETHODTABLE_ADDRESS --provider ghidra --json
rea function ./NativeAotFixture 0xADDRESS --provider ghidra --json
```

The generated `/NativeAOT/...` category path belongs to the optional headless
adapter. Use `--type /NativeAOT/MethodTables/Class_ADDRESS_MT` only when that
adapter is configured and has created the corresponding Ghidra DataType.
Built-in PE analysis includes its parser contract and resource policy in the
Ghidra analysis profile; non-PE profiles do not include that contract.

## Evidence boundaries

The built-in parser uses an initialized non-executable PE signature scan and
requires a unique RTR 9.1 header and exactly one DEHYDRATED_DATA row. Rehydrated
bytes live only in a parser-owned overlay, identified by virtual address, size,
and SHA-256; the caller's source Buffer remains unchanged. Limits derive from
captured section extents and format field bounds. Separate resource policies
admit up to 128 MiB of captured PE bytes, 64 MiB-equivalent parser work, 64 MiB
of exact parser-owned overlay/index Buffers, and 4 MiB of serialized NativeAOT
report JSON. These are local parser limits, independent of MCP delivery; the
buffer counter does not claim to cap V8 heap or total process memory. Rows that
do not fit the report budget are omitted with explicit partial status and
coverage. Coverage counts describe the pointer scan, recovered MethodTables,
and frozen-string candidates examined, not every possible runtime type or
object. Cancellation is honored during snapshot I/O and checked immediately
before and after parsing; the synchronous parser call itself is bounded but
cannot be interrupted mid-call. Parser output never claims that a Ghidra
database type was defined.

The optional adapter performs its annotations in an ephemeral Program
transaction. That workflow may change analysis-memory bytes, never the original
executable file. It is unavailable on Windows P0, which has no database
mutation authority.

REA preserves pre-recovery calling conventions and uses the loaded compiler
specification default for newly created methods. The upstream universal
`__thiscall` assignment is not treated as x64 ABI authority. Parameters and
method prototypes remain inferences; verify them against instructions/call sites.

Type relationships and System.Object/System.String identification use upstream
heuristics. Generated names are explicitly marked; original class/member names
and custom field layouts remain unknown. Pseudocode is recovered native logic,
not original C# source. Unsupported recovery reports its stage and reason; it
does not imply that ordinary native disassembly/decompilation is impossible.

## Verification

See [the dedicated lane](testing.md#optional-nativeaot-ghidra-analysis).
Fixtures are source-built benign .NET programs with inheritance, an interface,
virtual dispatch, representative arithmetic and frozen strings. Independent
compiler/linker symbols and raw directory bytes provide the oracle. Stripped
fixtures exercise heuristic detection. Tests do not execute the resulting
NativeAOT binaries. Fixture generation and adapter compilation are optional and
never prerequisites of ordinary native analysis or setup.
