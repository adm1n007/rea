# Ghidra conformance corpus

These source-owned fixtures are compiled at verification time; generated
binaries and Ghidra projects are never committed.

- `inventory.c` produces separate x86-64 debug and stripped ELF executables.
  It covers imports, an external `puts` function, linker thunks, source symbols,
  direct calls, a targetless callback call, two referenced strings, and a
  multi-block branch.
- `entry-aliases.c` preserves secondary imported entry labels, a bare-hex
  alias, and an interior label. The native CLI/MCP lane verifies entry selection,
  annotation, interior-label rejection, and unchanged source bytes.
- `cross-format.c` is freestanding so the verifier can produce AArch64 ELF,
  x86-64 PE, and x86-64 Mach-O targets from the same semantics. It preserves an
  exported entry, direct and indirect calls, a volatile string reference, and a
  multi-block branch across loaders.
- `no-return.c` and `ReaNoReturnProbe.java` inject incorrect import flags into a
  real ELF or Mach-O analysis database, verify caller recovery, propagated flag
  repair and signature preservation, and retain genuine/unknown no-return calls
  and independently identified entries. Run `npm run build:cached`, then
  `node scripts/verify-real-ghidra-noreturn.mjs` with the Ghidra/JDK environment
  below on Linux or macOS x64/arm64. On Linux, use a procps-compatible process
  table that exposes REA's current process for owned cleanup. It also checks
  named limitations through the real read-only TCP bridge and provider Evidence
  projection; default Unix-socket transport, Windows, and the reported Amethyst
  artifact need separate verification. Fixture target code is never executed.

`scripts/verify-real-ghidra.mjs` uses `cc`, `clang`, and `lld-link` by default;
`REA_CC`, `REA_CLANG`, and `REA_LLD_LINK` can select alternate commands. The
verifier requires the verified bring-your-own Ghidra 12.1.4 installation through
`GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR` and validates header classification before starting the
provider. Provider admission accepts the rest of the 12.1.x line; this lane does
not.

Conformance compares semantic facts: provider/profile identity, function
classification, resolved call edges, typed references, strings/xrefs, and CFG
topology. It only requires provider pseudocode and assembly to be non-empty,
bounded, and address-bearing; it never compares their text with Hopper. The
callback fixture also proves that an unresolved targetless flow is not silently
promoted to a direct callee. Every target runs in a separate owned project and
must leave no process, socket, project, or runtime root after close.

`relative-switch-signed.S` covers signed halfword offsets, the CBZ zero-entry
route, and selector biases of 0, 2 and 10 in the AArch64 jump-table lane. The
nonzero biases exercise overlapping and disjoint typed label/index ranges. REA
retains Ghidra's typed labels when the compared selector has an earlier register
definition; additional labels remain unknown until their relationship to the
typed switch selector can be proved. The oracle rejects extra numeric labels
and verifies each retained target against the source instruction immediate.
